A shader I put together to use in vrchat worlds.

### Improvements over standard:

- geometric specular antialiasing
- alpha to coverage
- bicubic lightmap interpolation
- directional lightmap specular
- bakery sh,rnm and specular
- better parallax
- anisotropy
- dithered lod crossfade
- audio link emission
- detail and mask map based on hdrp/lit
- shader lock in optimizer

#### Currently known missing features and bugs:

- dithered shadow with transparency
- generating materials for bakery might leave some material slots empty (probably fixed)
